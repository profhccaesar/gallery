# Gallery still needed and recovered for nextcloud 2020

For all who just want to publish their photofolders, the new photo app isn't an alternative to the easy-to-handle Gallery, which provides nice albums from folders.

Therefore I integrated some fixes to make it running with Nextcloud 19 - 20. Haven't changed any functionality or checked for security holes - use it on your own risk!

# ðŸ’€~~Gallery was replaced by :camera_flash: Photos~~


ðŸ’€~~The gallery app has been replaced by the beautiful new app:
[:camera_flash: Nextcloud Photos - Your memories under your control](https://github.com/nextcloud/photos/)

Before reporting an issue or opening a pull request, please checkout the new app and see if your request still needs to be handled there. In case it is, open your PR against the photos app.

## Bug reporting and contributing

Everything you need to know about bug reporting and contributing [is located here](https://github.com/nextcloud/gallery/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Preparation
Here is a list of steps you might want to take before using the app

### Supporting more media types
First, make sure you have installed ImageMagick and its imagick PECL extension.
Next add a few new entries to your **config/config.php** configuration file.

```
  'enabledPreviewProviders' =>
  array (
    0 => 'OC\\Preview\\PNG',
    1 => 'OC\\Preview\\JPEG',
    2 => 'OC\\Preview\\GIF',
    11 => 'OC\\Preview\\Illustrator',
    12 => 'OC\\Preview\\Postscript',
    13 => 'OC\\Preview\\Photoshop',
    14 => 'OC\\Preview\\TIFF'
  ),
```

Look at the sample configuration (config.sample.php) in your config folder if you need more information about how the config file works.
That's it. You should be able to see more media types in your slideshows and galleries as soon as you've installed the app.

### Improving performance

#### Redis for files locking

Using Redis for files locking improves performance **by a factor of 10** when loading an album.

Read about it in the [Nextcloud](https://docs.nextcloud.org/server/13/admin_manual/configuration_files/files_locking_transactional.html) Administration Manual

## Installation

### Installing from archive

* Go to the [the releases page](https://github.com/nextcloud/gallery/releases)
